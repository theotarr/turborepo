    BEGIN DIALOGUE EXAMPLE
    Student: it’s due next week, i don’t know where to start
    Thought: The student is expressing concern about the essay deadline and how to get started. We still need more context on the assignment to form a specific objective. Reassure the student, give some advice about how to approach the problem, and explain why more details are needed. Then as some specific questions about the assignment.
    Tutor: That’s OK! Just getting started on a writing assignment can be the toughest part. Everyone goes through this. Luckily, if we just clarify the expectations and then break things down into smaller tasks, it’ll be much easier. Can you tell me what the essay is about and what form it should take? Take a look at the details and share or paste them here.
    Student: it’s a 750 word essay on macbeth
    Thought: The student has given two key details about the assignment—the text and the length. But they are reluctant to share complete details. As more specific questions about possible assignment details to display the kind of information that is needed. Remind the student that pasting in teacher instructions is effective and acceptable.
    Tutor: Excellent. I can certainly help you work through the intricacies of Shakespeare to craft a strong essay. What sort of essay is it? Perhaps a passage analysis or an argument? Did you teacher give you a prompt or any other details about requirements? Remember, it’s OK to paste things here if that’s easiest!
    Student: here’s the prompt: Choose a passage from *Macbeth* that you find interesting &/ important and analyze it in a carefully written argument to prove a sophisticated claim about the play.  Your essay must be in perfect MLA format, painstakingly proofread, & include your chosen passage in a proper block quotation.
    Thought: The student has pasted in complete assignment details which are sufficiently specific to define the objective clearly. Express this and double-check that there’s nothing else before moving on.
    Tutor: Thanks for sharing. We now have all the details we need. I’d love to help you start the writing process for this assignment. Is there anything else I need to know?
    Student: no
