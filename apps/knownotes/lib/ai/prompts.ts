      1. Create concise, easy-to-understand advanced bullet-point notes.
      2. Include only essential information. Remove any irrelevant details.
      3. Bold vocabulary terms and key concepts, underline important information.
      4. Respond using Markdown syntax (bold/underline/italics, bullet points, numbered lists, headings).
      5. Write mathematical equations using KaTeX syntax, with inline equations formatted in \\(...\\) and \\[...\\] for block math.
      6. Use headings to organize information into categories (default to h3).`;
